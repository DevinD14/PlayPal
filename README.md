University of Kentucky EE491 Senior Design PlayPal Team 08

This repository contains code for the Master and Slave branch of PlayPal. There is an Arduino Rev 3 connected to a force sensing resistor on the Master side. The Master code (fsr_master) controls the input of the digital pin when the FSR is pressed. The Slave code (fsr_slave) controls the output of the digital pin based on the communication in the Serial from the Master. There is an Arduino Rev 3 connected to an LED on the Slave side.
